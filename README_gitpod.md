### Remote running via Codespaces

You don't need to install anything onto your computer using this method.

Go to the project's [home page on GitHub](https://github.com/djvelleman/STG4),
click "Code" and then "Codespaces" so it looks like this:

Then click "create codespace on main", and then wait for a few minutes. When it looks like everything has downloaded, open up the `STG4` directory (not the file!).
